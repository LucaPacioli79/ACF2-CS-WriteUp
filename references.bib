	abstract = {(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street banks have long relied on a familiar system to limit the dangers of trading with big clients: assign sales staff to win deals, and risk controllers to keep them in check -- even if it sacrifices some profit.At Credit Suisse Group AG, executives had given the point salesman to Archegos Capital Management on its swaps desk the new responsibility of instead overseeing risk-taking in the broader prime-brokerage unit, according to people with knowledge of the matter. This year, Archegos’s swap bets spectacularly collapsed, saddling the bank with a \$4.7 billion writedown, and setting it up as the biggest loser to emerge from the debacle at Bill Hwang’s family office. Parshu Shah -- the salesman who became head of prime-services risk -- hasn’t been accused of any impropriety in previous trades with Archegos. But the bank has faced questions in the wake of the debacle over whether managers prioritized boosting revenue over managing against downside. Shah is among a roster of Credit Suisse executives who’ve been forced to step down following the blowup, according to an internal memo early this month. The usually behind-the-scenes functions of risk controls have been thrust into the limelight after Credit Suisse was left holding the bag on two financial catastrophes in just a month -- Hwang’s firm and the collapse of Greensill Capital. The Swiss lender’s losses have left investors puzzling over whether it has sufficient checks in place. In recent years, Credit Suisse Chief Executive Officer Thomas Gottstein and his predecessor Tidjane Thiam gave the task of resetting the bank’s risk appetite to Lara Warner, head of risk and compliance, who is stepping down as well. She challenged managers in her division to stop thinking only about defending the bank’s capital and also look at strategic business priorities, Bloomberg reported earlier. While it’s not typical for revenue-generating finance employees to switch to risk-oversight roles, some banks make such shifts.Credit Suisse, the worst-performing major bank stock this year, is set to disclose first-quarter earnings results on Thursday that are likely to involve a more-detailed discussion around the Archegos mess. Anna Christensen, a spokeswoman for Credit Suisse declined to comment for the firm and Shah, or say how long he’d been in the risk-oversight position. Shah, who has been with the bank for more than 20 years, was one of the people at the firm who helped nurture the relationship with Archegos as the fund began growing in size.When Shah left the swaps desk, his sales role ended and he took over the new oversight position within the prime-brokerage group. That job included overseeing the risk of several clients, including Archegos. An existing member of Shah’s team was assigned to Hwang’s firm for monitoring its activity on a daily basis, according to a Credit Suisse executive who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. The prime-brokerage risk group was one among several lines of defense set up to shield a firm of Credit Suisse’s size from confronting hefty losses in dealings with any one client. But the enormity of the bank’s exposure coupled with the rapid implosion of Hwang’s firm ripped through the safety net Credit Suisse had set up, leaving management befuddled, the lender’s workforce frustrated and investors furious. In 2016, under then-CEO Thiam, Credit Suisse underwent a significant restructuring of its risk functions that led to many people leaving. The risk-control center was shifted to Zurich, Credit Suisse’s headquarters, from New York, where the majority of the bank’s investment-banking and trading activities sit. Since the restructuring, efforts to cut costs have damped the bank’s ability to add talent and replenish the defense lines, a person familiar with the matter said. ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.},

	url = {https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/credit-suisse-overruled-risk-managers-on-greensill-loan/46441322},
	abstract = {(Bloomberg) -- Credit Suisse Group AG brushed off concerns from some risk managers about a \$140 million loan to Greensill Capital that the bank extended a few months before the trade finance firm collapsed. Risk managers at Credit Suisse’s investment bank in London were initially reluctant to grant the request, according to a person familiar with the matter. They then discussed the matter with their counterparts in the Swiss and Asian private banking units, and the bank’s risk chief Lara Warner signed off on the loan in October, the person said, asking not to be identified in discussing internal information. A spokesperson for Credit Suisse declined to comment. The Financial Times reported earlier that London-based risk managers were overruled on the loan, which the newspaper put at \$160 million, and that Warner had signed off on the transaction. Credit Suisse fell as much as 4.7\% in early Friday trading. The shares have lost about 10\% since the bank’s relationship with Greensill started to unravel two weeks ago. The bank’s risk-taking has come under scrutiny after a number of missteps in the past year, some of them linked to high-profile clients. The bank pursues a strategy of deepening relationships with its richest customers, typically entrepreneurs whose companies do business with the investment banking unit while the wealth management divisions oversee their personal finances. Early last year, Credit Suisse was among lenders exposed to Luckin Coffee Inc., the onetime challenger to Starbucks. The bank had praised founder Lu Zhengyao as the poster child for its strategy, arranged the company’s initial public offering and lent Lu millions of dollars, but was left staring at losses when the stock imploded in an accounting fraud. Lex Greensill, the onetime billionaire founder of Greensill Capital, also had a deep relationship with Credit Suisse and was a client of its private bank in Switzerland and Asia, the person said. Greensill Capital was running four supply chain finance funds with the bank’s asset management unit, it had a lending relationship with the bank and it was considering an IPO. The bank froze the Greensill-linked funds last week and is now liquidating them, amid concerns about the valuations of some of the assets and after a major insurer of the holding declined to extend fresh coverage. Executives at the bank knew early on that a large portion of the assets in the funds were tied to Sanjeev Gupta, a Greensill client whose borrowings were at the center of a 2018 scandal at rival asset manager GAM Holding AG, Bloomberg has reported. As of April 2018, about a third of the assets in the strategy’s flagship were linked to Gupta’s GFG Alliance companies or his customers as of April 2018, according to a filing. The exposure is across the funds now at least \$1 billion to \$2 billion, the FT reported, citing unidentified people with knowledge of the matter. Analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on Thursday cut their recommendation on Credit Suisse shares to neutral, citing the shares’ rally over the past 12 months. “Our downgrade does not reflect concern about the operating performance of Credit Suisse, or indeed its long-term prospects,” analysts Jernej Omahen and Alexandre Dupuy wrote in the report. While “operating performance did excel, non-operating items have been a persistent drag.” Credit Suisse has temporarily replaced three managers linked to the funds. It has started an internal probe into the collapse of the funds and has sought external help to deal with queries from regulators.
